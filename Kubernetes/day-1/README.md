  <summary><b>When Docker Alone is Enough (click to expand)</b></summary>

You can use only Docker (without Kubernetes) when:

✅ your application is small  
✅ you run 3 to 10 containers  
✅ users are not facing issues  
✅ scaling is limited  
✅ manual management is easy  
✅ one machine/server is enough  
✅ no auto-healing required  
✅ no complex networking needed  

👉 **Simple line:**  
If things are running smoothly and containers are few, Docker is enough — no need to complicate life.

  <summary><b>When Kubernetes is Required (click to expand)</b></summary>

You should use Kubernetes when:

✅ you have 30 to 100+ containers  
✅ containers need automatic monitoring  
✅ containers must restart if they fail  
✅ load balancing is required  
✅ traffic increases and scaling is needed  
✅ multiple servers/nodes are used  
✅ deployments need automation  
✅ rolling updates / zero downtime needed  
✅ self-healing required  

👉 **Simple line:**  
If container count, traffic, scaling, automation, and reliability increase — Kubernetes becomes necessary.
