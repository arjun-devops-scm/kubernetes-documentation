# What is a Docker 
   **Docker is a tool that helps you package an application along with everything it needs like libraries, settings, and dependencies, so that it can run the same way on any computer or any environment.**

-  What is the difference between Virtualization and  Dockerization

<details>
  <summary><b>Virtualization (click to expand)</b></summary>

Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple virtual machines on a single physical computer, where each virtual machine has its own operating system, resources, and environment. It isolates hardware.

#### 🚀 Examples: Virtualization is like:
- ✅ setting up a full new house
- ✅ with its own bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, electricity
- ✅ even if you just want to make Maggi

#### 🚀 So a Virtual Machine has:
- ✅ full operating system
- ✅ heavy setup
- ✅ needs more RAM & CPU
- ✅ slow to start
